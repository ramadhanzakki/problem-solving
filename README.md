# 🧠 Problem Solving Collection

Welcome to my **Problem Solving** repository!

This repository is a personal collection of my solutions to various programming challenges, logic problems, and algorithm exercises. The main purpose of this repository is to document my journey in honing my _problem-solving_ skills and implementing efficient algorithms.

## 🎯 Platforms

The problems found here come from various popular coding practice platforms, including:

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/ "null")
    
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/ "null")
    
- [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/ "null")
    
- And other sources.
    

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each problem usually has its own directory containing:

- Solution code (generally written in **Python**, as per the repository description).
    
- (Optional) Additional notes or a specific README file for the problem if further explanation is needed.
    

Example structure:

```
problem-solving/
├── Remove Element/
|   ├── data/
